# AWS App Runner Setup Guide

This guide walks you through the process of setting up the infrastructure for the NicorAI application using AWS App Runner for the backend and S3/CloudFront for the frontend.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS Account with appropriate permissions
2. AWS CLI installed and configured

## Infrastructure Setup

### 1. Set Up GitHub Connection in AWS

Create a connection to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to the AWS Developer Tools console
2. Navigate to "Settings" > "Connections"
3. Click "Create connection"
4. Select "GitHub" as the provider
5. Name your connection (e.g., "nicorai-github-connection")
6. Click "Connect to GitHub" and authorize AWS
7. Select your GitHub repository
8. Complete the connection setup

Take note of the Connection ARN, which you'll need for your App Runner service configuration.

### 2. Verify Backend Package.json Build Script

The `nicorai-api-gateway/package.json` file should include a build script for App Runner to use during deployment. This script should be defined as:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js",
  "build": "echo \"No build step required\" && exit 0",
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
}
```

If the `build` script is missing, add it to the package.json file. This is required for App Runner to successfully deploy from the GitHub source connection, even if no actual build step is needed.

### 3. Set up App Runner Service manually

1. Go to the AWS App Runner console
2. Click "Create service"
3. For source, select "Source code repository"
4. Select the GitHub connection you created earlier
5. Select your repository and branch (typically main)
6. Configure build settings:
   - Runtime: Node.js 20
   - Build command: `npm ci`
   - Start command: `node index.js`
   - Port: 4000
7. Configure service settings:
   - Service name: nicorai-api-gateway
   - CPU: 1 vCPU
   - Memory: 2 GB
8. Configure environment variables:
   - NODE_ENV: production
   - REDIS_URL: your-redis-connection-string
   - N8N_WEBHOOK_URL: your-n8n-webhook-url
9. Enable auto deployment (so changes to your repository are automatically deployed)
10. Configure any additional settings like VPC, security, etc.
11. Click "Create & Deploy"

12. Note the Service ARN and URL from the service details page - you'll need these for your GitHub secrets.

### 4. Set up S3 and CloudFront for Frontend

1. Create an S3 bucket for hosting static files:
   - Go to S3 console and click "Create bucket"
   - Enter a bucket name (e.g., nicorai-frontend)
   - Enable "Static website hosting" under Properties
   - Set permissions to allow public access
   - Add a bucket policy to grant public read access

2. Create a CloudFront distribution:
   - Go to CloudFront console and click "Create distribution"
   - Origin domain: Your S3 bucket website endpoint
   - Default root object: `index.html`
   - Error pages: Create a custom error response for 404 errors that redirects to /index.html
   - Set default cache behavior (recommended: cache most content except HTML)
   - Configure other settings as needed
   - Create distribution and note the distribution ID and domain name
     For Next.js specifically:
   - If using static export (`output: 'export'` in next.config.ts), the default index.html works as expected
   - If using server-side rendering, our deployment workflow creates an index.html that redirects to the proper entry point
   
   **CloudFront Error Page Configuration for Client-Side Routing:**
   1. In CloudFront distribution settings, go to "Error Pages"
   2. Create custom error response:
      - HTTP error code: 403 (Forbidden)
      - Response page path: /index.html
      - HTTP response code: 200 (OK)
   3. Create another custom error response:
      - HTTP error code: 404 (Not Found)
      - Response page path: /index.html
      - HTTP response code: 200 (OK)
   
   This configuration is crucial for Next.js client-side routing to work correctly when hosted on S3/CloudFront.

### 5. Configure GitHub Secrets

Set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. AWS credentials:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `AWS_REGION`

2. Frontend (S3/CloudFront):
   - `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
   - `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`
   - `CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN_NAME`

3. Backend (App Runner):
   - `APPRUNNER_SERVICE_ARN`
   - `APPRUNNER_SERVICE_NAME`
   - `REDIS_URL`
   - `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`

## Deployment Process

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend follows a CI/CD approach using GitHub Actions:

1. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Go to Actions > Deploy Frontend > Click "Run workflow"
   - This lets you trigger a deployment without making code changes

2. **Automatic Deployment**:
   - When code is pushed to the main branch in the frontend directory
   - The workflow automatically builds and deploys to S3/CloudFront
   - This is handled by the deploy-frontend.yml workflow

### Backend Deployment

For the backend service:

- App Runner automatically deploys when changes are detected in the repository
- No GitHub Actions workflow is needed since App Runner handles this natively
- You can manage deployments directly from the AWS App Runner console

## Monitoring

The "Frontend Infrastructure Maintenance Check" workflow runs weekly to check the health of:
- S3 bucket accessibility and content
- CloudFront distribution status
- CloudFront error page configuration for Next.js routing

This workflow creates GitHub issues with status reports automatically every Monday morning.

## Testing Production Builds Locally

Before deploying, it's a good practice to test production builds locally. Here are the verified steps:

### Testing Backend Production Build

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```powershell
   cd nicorai-api-gateway
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm ci
   ```

3. Run the build script:
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   ```
   This will show "No build step required" since our backend doesn't need a compilation step.

4. Set required environment variables (use values from your .env file):
   ```powershell
   $env:NODE_ENV = "production"
   $env:REDIS_URL = "rediss://default:password@your-redis-host:6379"
   $env:N8N_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://n8n.srv810314.hstgr.cloud/webhook/chat"
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

6. Verify that the server starts successfully on port 4000.

### Testing Frontend Production Build

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm ci
   ```

3. Build the application with static export:
   ```powershell
   npx next build --no-lint
   ```
   
   Note: We use `--no-lint` because the current codebase has linting errors that would prevent the build from completing, but these are not critical for the actual functionality.
   
   The build will generate a static site in the `out` directory thanks to the `output: 'export'` setting in next.config.ts.

4. Verify the static export:
   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem -Path out
   ```

   This should show the static files including `index.html`, which is the entry point for CloudFront.

5. Test the static site locally (optional):
   ```powershell
   npx serve out
   ```

   And open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to verify the build works correctly.   For our Next.js static export, when deploying to S3/CloudFront, our GitHub Actions workflow will:
   
   - Build with `--no-lint` option to bypass linting errors
   - Use the `out` directory containing HTML, CSS, and JS files
   - Apply proper GZIP compression to text-based assets
   - Set correct content types for different file extensions
   - Ensure index.html is the default root object in CloudFront
   - Configure CloudFront error pages to support client-side routing
